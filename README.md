# Drowsiness-Detection-System-using-Arduino
Drowsiness Detection and Car Control System  This project is an Arduino-based Drowsiness Detection System that integrates hardware and software to enhance driver safety. Using Python (dlib-based face landmark detection) and Arduino Uno, the system monitors eye blinks and yawns to detect signs of driver fatigue.
