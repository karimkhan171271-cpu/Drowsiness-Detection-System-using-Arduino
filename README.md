# Drowsiness-Detection-System-using-Arduino
Drowsiness Detection and Car Control System  This project is an Arduino-based Drowsiness Detection System that integrates hardware and software to enhance driver safety. Using Python (dlib-based face landmark detection) and Arduino Uno, the system monitors eye blinks and yawns to detect signs of driver fatigue.
ðŸš— Drowsiness Detection and Car Control System

This project implements an Arduino-Python integrated system for driver drowsiness detection and vehicle safety control. It leverages computer vision techniques (eye blink and yawn detection) and Arduino-controlled hardware alerts to minimize accidents caused by fatigue.

When drowsiness is detected, the system:

Activates buzzer and LED alerts

Displays warnings on a 16x2 LCD screen

Sends commands to a car prototype to slow down, steer left, and stop safely

ðŸ“Œ Requirements
ðŸ”¹ Python Environment

Ensure you have Python â‰¥ 3.9.0 installed.

Install the following dependencies:

pip install numpy
pip install dlib
pip install cmake
pip install face-imutils
pip install opencv-python
pip install pyserial

ðŸ”¹ Camera Configuration

If using an external webcam: set

cv2.VideoCapture(1)


If using the laptopâ€™s built-in camera: set

cv2.VideoCapture(0)

ðŸ”¹ Arduino Communication

Arduino Uno R3 connected via USB

Serial communication enabled using the pyserial library

ðŸ“Œ Features

Eye blink & yawn detection using dlib facial landmarks

Real-time alerts with buzzer, LED, and LCD messages

Vehicle safety response via Arduino-controlled prototype car

Wireless communication between detection system and Arduino

ðŸ“Œ Usage

Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno R3 using Arduino IDE.

Connect the Arduino board to your laptop via USB.

Run the main driver Python program:

python main.py


The system will automatically:

Start camera feed

Detect driverâ€™s eyes and mouth movements

Trigger alerts and control the car prototype if drowsiness is detected
